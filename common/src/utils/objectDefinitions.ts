 * unfortunately.
 *
 * For example, take the partial A, whose function has parameters `[number, number]`; and the partial B, whose
 * parameters are `[string, string]`. If B extends A, then the resulting function returned by this type will
 * have parameters of type `[[string, string], [number, number]]`

 * this type will have parameters of type `[[boolean, boolean], [[string, string], [number, number]]]`

 * @template ApplierFn The type of the extended partial's (aka the one doing the inheriting) function

 * @param inheritArgs The arguments to pass to the inherited partial's (aka the one being inherited from) function.
 * See the API note for more information regarding the format these are passed in
 * @returns The result of combining the inherited definition with the extended definition. (_**WARNING**: This is currently
